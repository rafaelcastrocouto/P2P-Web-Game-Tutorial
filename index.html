PART 1: Welcome to me web game tutorial!

Our goal here is to build a space shooter.

At any time during this tutorial you can change
the code to test how it works. Don't worry if you
break it, you can always undo with ctrl+z or just
navigate back to the original repl.it to reset.

We are gonna use three languages, HTML, CSS and JS. 
If you are not familiar with then, please 
take some time just to learn the basics:

https://www.w3schools.com/html/
https://www.w3schools.com/css/
https://www.w3schools.com/js/

Now that we are familiar with our languages,
let's put'em to good use. 

HTML are the files that are downloaded 
by the browser when a user open any web page. 
When you go to a website like: 

  http:// www.site.com/someFile.txt

As expected, the default server configuration
will download the file "someFile.txt".

But when you don't write the file and go to:

  http://www.site.com

servers will most likely respond with the 
"index.html" located in the corresponding 
directory. as if you typed:

  http://www.site.com/index.html

So this is OUR index.html, our main structure.
The game will have only one HTML file,
this will make things easier!

So lets start our HTML5 coding!
We will tell the browser that we are using the
last version of HTML with the doctype declaration.

==============================================-->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--==============================================

That's it, now we are ready to write down our
elements. Let's start diving into HTML markup.

==============================================-->

<html>

<!--==============================================

In HTML we have a basic structure that divides
the head (meta data) and the body (content).
Let's start with the meta data.

==============================================-->

  <head>

<!--==============================================

Now we are inside out HTML head. Braaains!!!
Here we'll import our CSS files, this files will
tell the browser the style of our HTML elements.

The head is a good place for them because when the
browser starts to render the page, we want all this
style data to be already defined.

The <link> tag will download and apply the style
pointed in the "href" attribute.

==============================================-->

    <link href="2-styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<!--==============================================

As you might have guessed by the file name, 
we are going to dive into the style on part 2.
    
The last thing we are going to put in the head is
the HTML title. It will tell the browser what to
write at the window/tab top bar.

==============================================-->

    <title>Space Game Title</title>

<!--==============================================

We want to support mobile devices screen. This
meta tag will inform the smartphones how to 
render our game dimensions correctly.

==============================================-->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/>
    
<!--==============================================

We are done with our head elements,
so let's close our tag:

==============================================-->

  </head>  <!-- close head -->

<!--==============================================

Time for some body work! 
Here we gonna put the elements that will appear
on the user interface screen and our JS scripts.

We are going to use only six types of HTML tags 
in our body:

1: A title heading: <h1>Title</h1>
2: Divisions to nest other elements: <div><...></div>
3: We use a canvas to draw things: <canvas>Text</canvas>
4: A caption for our sliders <label>Text</label>
5: Input sliders to costumize our ships: <input type="range" />
6: And buttons for user to interaction: <button>Text</button>

  <input type="button" value="Click here"/>
  <input type="range" value="50"/>

We could (and probably should) use other tags,
since HTML should be as semantic as possible.
But let's keep it simple for this tutorial.

So now we have all we need to start our 
<body> structure. 
  
==============================================-->
  
  <body>

<!--==============================================
    
All our content will live
inside a container <div>, this will make easy 
for us to center it on screen.

With the class attribute we can name our elements
and later we will be able to reference or query 
them in our CSS and JS code with SELECTORS.
If you are not familiar with this
concept you can learn about it here:
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

==============================================-->

    <div class="container">

<!--==============================================

Elements are rendered on screen in order of 
appearance (last elements are on top), 
unless you change this with your CSS code.
So the first thing on our container will be our 
<canvas> element because we want it below all
other elements.
      
The easiest way to understand the canvas element
is to think of it as a Microsoft's Paint but you
can only draw with JS code.

We will learn how to use the canvas on p07, 
but if you are curious, you can quickly learn the
basic stuff in here:
https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp

==============================================-->

      <canvas class="screen">No canvas support</canvas>
      
<!--==============================================

Next we will build our user interface.
As before let's put it all in a div,
for styling and organization. HTML allows
a div to have other div childs, that creates
a tree like structure that after parsed by the
browser is called DOM.
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp
      
==============================================-->

      <div class="ui">
      
<!--==============================================

We will build two interfaces for thew user, the
ship sliders. and the mobile controls.

Let's start with the ship user interface menu. 
We will also put them all inside a <div>
      
==============================================-->

        <div class="shipMenu">
          
<!--==============================================

The game title will have a bigger font, so we
put it into a heading tag.
      
==============================================-->
          
          <h1>Space Game</h1>
          
<!--==============================================

Now let's add some sliders, they will 
allow the player to customize their ship.
The default values for the range elements are:

<input type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1" value="50">

Since those values are fine for us, 
I will omit them for brevity's sake,
but try to keep them in mind.

Let's make three slider: attack, speed and control.
Each one of them will be preceded by a explanatory
text, inside a <label> tag.

==============================================-->
          
          <!-- attack slider -->
          <label for="attack">Attack: X OR Space</label>
          <input name="attack" type="range" />
          
          <!-- speed slider -->
          <label for="speed">Speed: W or Up Arrow</label>
          <input name="speed" type="range" />
          
          <!-- control slider -->
          <label for="control">Control: A-D or Left-Right</label>
          <input name="control" type="range" />

<!--==============================================

The next item in our user interface is a button.
There's no game without a button, right?
The 'play' button will allow the player close 
the ship customization menu and start playing.

We are going to enable it in our JavasCript code.
          
==============================================-->

          <button name="play" disabled>Play</button>

        </div> <!-- close div.shipMenu -->

<!--==============================================

The next menu will allow users to play on mobile
devices or by clicking with the mouse. 
This menu will start hidden and only appear 
after the play button is pressed.

==============================================-->

      <div class="mobileMenu hidden">

<!--==============================================

Let's group up the movement buttons to make it
easier to control their position.
        
==============================================-->
        
        <div>
          <button name="up">Move</button>
          <div class="mobileControls">
            <button name="left"><</button>
            <button name="right">></button>
          </div>
        </div>

<!--==============================================

Our last buttons will allow player to edit their
ship customization and to shoot.
        
==============================================-->
        
        <button name="edit">Edit</button>
        <button name="shoot">Shoot</button>
        
      </div> <!-- close div.mobileUI -->
        
<!--==============================================

That's all of our game user interface structure, 
let's not forget to close their div elements.

==============================================-->

      </div>  <!-- close div.ui -->
      
    </div>  <!-- close div.container -->

<!--==============================================

The last thing we need to do in the HTML 
is to import all the JS code. 
The <script> tag will to just that, we just need
to write down each "src" attribute.
It's important to remember that  they will 
be executed in order.
    
4web is the module that will take care of our
network sharing the p2p connections and use 
the revolt channel as our signaling service.

Learn more about importing modules here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules
    
==============================================-->

    <script src="./lib/4web.js" type="module"></script>

<!--==============================================

Now we list all JS code we are going to learn
in the following lessons:

==============================================-->
    
<!--             1 index.html that's the file we are right now      -->
<!--             2-styles.css we've already imported it in the head -->
    <script src="3-world-asteroids.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="4-player-physics.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="5-user-interface.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="6-keyboard-input.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="7-canvas-draw.js"     type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="8-world-stars.js"     type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="9-player-ship.js"     type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="10-game-network.js"   type="text/javascript"></script>

<!--==============================================

And that's the end of our game HTML, 
now we can close the <body> and the <html>.

==============================================-->

  </body>  <!-- close body -->
  
</html>  <!-- close html -->

<!--==============================================

Next we will learn how to style our elements and
make them shine with our CSS code. 
So go on and open the "p02-styles.css" file.

==============================================-->
